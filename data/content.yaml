Profile: |
  I am a driven and motivated software developer capable of both self-starting and self-teaching. After over 5 years as a software support agent that has always been passionate about tech, I became more interested in software development. 
  I started by teaching myself software development, complementing my knowledge by joining a coding bootcamp and attending coding meet-ups. <br/>
  I currently specialise in a modern tech stack centred on React and TypeScript, with some familiarity with AWS. I find strength in my adaptability, problem-solving skills, and a strong affinity for writing clean, maintainable code.<br/>
  Looking ahead, my career aspirations align with taking on new challenges and progressing into roles that allow me to further expand my skills as a software engineer.
